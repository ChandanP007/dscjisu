# About this event

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For example, if you are writing a paper, you can keep track of different versions of the paper and revert back to an older version if necessary.

Version control systems are most commonly used by software developers to track changes in source code, but they can be used for any type of file.

There are many different version control systems, but the most popular one is Git.

In this session, we will discuss:

- What is version control?
- What is Git?
- How to use Git for version control?
- How to collaborate with others using Git?
- What are some best practices for using Git?
- We will also demo how to use Git for version control.

This session is for anyone who is interested in learning about version control and how to use Git. No prior experience is necessary.
