## Types of Internet

Internet is divided into three main Categories namely Surface Web, Deep Web and the Dark Web

- Surface web: ​Any Web pages, Websites , Web Applications etc. which we find on the internet in our daily life that is Surface Web. Searches made by Google, Bing or Yahoo all give results that are present on the surface web. In this vast ocean of the internet only 3-4%is Surface Web.

- Deep Web: ​The results that we are not able to get by doing a normal search that is the Deep Web. Basically these sites are not indexed by search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo etc. 96% of the internet comprises the Deep Web. This means that the information that common people are accessing is just like the tip of an iceberg if compared to it.The Deep Web includes Details that should not be accessed just by doing a common search like Bank Details, Medical Records, Your Aadhaar/PAN numbers, Private Networks etc. It contains both legal and illegal content.

- Dark Web: ​It is the most dangerous place one can visit on the internet. It contains all the illegal stuff like human trafficking, drug deals, sale of weapons that are illegal and many other horrifying things. This can not be accessed by a normal web browser. Tor browser, also known as the Onion Browser(Tor) is used to surf the Dark web. Silk Road exists on Dark web. Silk Road is the online Black Market where drug deals are done.

## What is DarkWeb ?

The dark web is the hidden collection of internet sites only accessible by a specialized web browser.It is used for keeping internet activity anonymous and private, which can be helpful in both legal and illegal applications. Dark web pages don’t appear when you look for them in a search engine, so you need to know the exact address of the website you want to visit.

## Darkweb accessibility & Services

The dark web is only accessible through a special browser that is “Tor browser”.

- Tor browser : It is a browser that helps you maintain your anonymity.”If a person is listening to traffic on your network, he would not be able to learn from where the packets are arriving because tor makes many hops before reaching the server.”
  In simple language, Tor browser helps you to hide your identity !

However, you need to use Tor browser very carefully because even a small mistake can lead to compromise of your anonymity. After opening the tor browser you should resize your browser window because any person who wants to capture your traffic will be able to identify you by capturing your screen size & will be able to know which device you are using !

The darkweb websites don’t end with (.in) (.com) or (.org) The URLs usually consist of a random mix of letters and numbers.They also end with (.onion)

The URLs of dark web sites change regularly, so they aren’t as easy to find as most platforms on other parts of the internet.

The address of darkweb on tor browser for example, might be something like
(https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion)

There are some dedicated pages that can help us to find darkweb links.These pages usually even categorize their “onion links,” making it easier for you to browse through their list of links. Here are two resources,...

## Conclusion

The Dark Web networks such as TOR have provided many possibilities for malicious actors to exchange legal and illegal “goods” anonymously. In this paper,I discussed the impact of the Dark Web, respectively privacy and anonymity of it. Through the results, it is shown the anonymous users daily number of this Internet segment for the Kosovo(blackbird) region as well as the whole world and how much the impact of hidden services websites on the Dark web. There are so many activities done on the dark web like “red rooms”, “black magics” & many horrible things. If you want to accept these creepy things then you should explore !

GOOD LUCK (:
