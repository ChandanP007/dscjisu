Before going into the syntax of a C++ program, let us first understand some basic terms.

## Tokens :

To understand Tokens, let us first take the example of an atom. We all know that an atom is the smallest unit of matter. Similarly, a token is the **smallest unit** of a program. They can be described as the **fundamental building blocks** that constitute a program.

## Types of Tokens :

- Keywords
- Identifiers
- Constants
- Literals
- Special Symbols
- Variables
- Operators

## Keywords :

Keywords are the **reserved words** in C++ which have a **predefined meaning** to the **compiler**.

As C++ is an extension of the C language, It supports the **32 keywords** that are also available in C.

In addition, C++ supports **31 more keywords** that are not available in C.

## Identifiers :

The **unique names** assigned to **identify** the different parts( **functions, variables, structures, class** etc) of a program are called **Identifiers**.

### The naming convention for Identifiers is as follows :

- An Identifier consists of only **alphabets, characters, digits, and underscores(\_)**.
- It should not contain **whitespace** or any other **special character**.
- The first letter of an Identifier must be an alphabet or an underscore(\_).
- Identifiers in C++ are **case sensitive**( which means that **'var'** and **'VAR'** are different).
- **Reserved words** cannot be used as Identifiers.

```cpp
int enum; ❌ // an Identifier cannot be a keyword
int var; ✅ // valid Identifier
int 1sum; ❌ // an Identifier cannot start with a digit
int _sum1; ✅ // valid Identifier
int var@1; ❌ // an Identifier cannot have a special character
```

## Constants :

Constants refer to the components whose value **cannot** be **changed ** throughout the program. Constants must have to be **initialized** at the time of creating it and a new value **cannot be assigned** to it later on.

### There are two ways of defining Constants in C++ :

- By using the **const** keyword: Using the **const keyword ** before a variable makes it a Constant.

### Syntax :

```
const  data_type  constant_name = value;
```

### Example :

```cpp
const int val=5; // a constant 'val' is declared with value 5

const int val;
val=5; ❌ // it should be initialized in the first line
```

- By using **#define** preprocessor: The preprocessors are the **directives** which give instructions to the compiler to **preprocess** information or **perform a task** before the **actual compilation** of the program starts. All the preprocessor directives are therefore declared before the **main( )**.

![preprocessor.jpg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654959274503/8UyApjSPq.jpg align="left")

**#define** preprocessor directive is used to define a **constant value** with a **name**. The compiler will **replace references** to these constants with the **defined value** at the time of compilation.

### Syntax :

```
#define   constant_name   value
```

### Example :

```cpp
#define   val   5  // a constant 'val' is defined with value 5
```

### Types of Constants :

![constants.jpg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654959243702/YEUZBAkTZ.jpg align="left")

- **Integer Constants** - constants that have numeric values with no fractional or exponential part. **Example: **0, 1, 999, -567, etc.
- **Real or Floating-point Constants** - constants that have numeric values with fractional or exponential part. **Example:** 0.45, 0.6669, 1.25, etc.
- **Character Constants** - Constants that have a character enclosed within single quotations. **Example:** 'A', 'b', 'Z', etc.
- **String Constants** - Constants that have a group of characters enclosed within double quotations. **Example:** "Code for Community".

## Literals :

Literals are used for representing **fixed** values( or **Constant** values). In other words, a **Constant value** is called a **Literal**.

### Example :

```cpp
const   int   a = 9; // 'a' is a constant and '9' is a literal
```

### Types of Literals :

- **Integer Literals** - numeric values with no fractional or exponential part. **Example: **0, -1, 022, 0x521, etc.
- **Floating-point Literals** - numeric values with fractional or exponential part. **Example:** 0.99E-2, 0.000024, -1.25, etc.
- **Character Literals** - consists of a single character enclosed within single quotations. **Example:** 'C', 'd', 'X', etc.
- **String Literals** - consists of a group of characters enclosed within double quotations. **Example:** "Hashnode".
- **Escape sequence** - Sometimes, it is necessary to use characters that cannot be typed directly through the keyboard. These characters can be represented through an **escape sequence**.

An escape sequence is a **special character** that can be used to **manipulate** the **printing behavior** of the **output**. They are used with a **backslash(\)** followed by a **coded** **character**.

For example, if we were to print "Hello World" in the **same line**, we would simply write

```cpp
cout << "Hello World" ;
```

Now, if we were to print "Hello" and "World" in **two different lines**, we can use **\n** to send the cursor to the next line

```cpp
cout << "Hello \n";
cout << "World"; // 'World' will be printed in the next line
```

**Here are a few examples of escape sequence :
**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th> Escape Sequence </th>
    <th> Character </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \n </td>
    <td> nextline </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \b </td>
    <td> backspace </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \r </td>
    <td> return </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \t </td>
    <td> horizontal tab </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \v </td>
    <td> vertical tab </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \\ </td>
    <td> backslash </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \' </td>
    <td> single quotation mark </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \" </td>
    <td> double quotation mark </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \? </td>
    <td> question mark </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \0 </td>
    <td> null character </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Special Symbols :

C++ supports a variety of symbols that conveys a special meaning. These special symbols, therefore, cannot be used for any other purpose other than their specified function in the program.

### The following are some of the **Special Symbols** supported by C++ :

- **Brackets [ ]:** Opening and closing brackets are used to declare array size and access array elements.
- **Parentheses ( ):** These special symbols are used to indicate function calls and function parameters.
- **Braces { }:** These opening and ending curly braces mark the start and end of a block of code containing more than one executable statement.
- **Comma (, ):** It is used to separate more than one expression in an executable statement like parameters in function calls.
- **Colon (:):** It is an operator that essentially invokes something called an initialization list.
- **Semicolon (;):** It is known as a statement terminator. It indicates the end of one logical entity. That’s why each statement must be ended with a semicolon.
- **Asterisk (\*):** It is used to create a pointer variable and for the multiplication of variables.
- **Assignment operator (=):** It is used to assign values to a variable.
- **Pre-processor (#):** The preprocessor is a directive that is used automatically by the compiler to modify our program before the actual compilation.

This is it for this blog post, we would be discussing Variables and Operators in the next one. Till then Keep Learning...
