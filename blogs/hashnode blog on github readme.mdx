## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows you to automate your workflow. It is a CI/CD tool that allows you to build, test, and deploy your code. It is a great way to automate your workflow and save time. You can also use it to automate your Hashnode blogs on your GitHub profile.

## What is Hashnode?

Hashnode is a blogging platform for developers. It is a great place to share your knowledge and learn from others. It is a great place to share your knowledge and learn from others. It is a great place to share your knowledge and learn from others.

## How to add Hashnode blogs to your GitHub profile?

Follow up these steps and make your GitHub profile synced with your Hashnode one!

### Create the special repository

Create a new repository with the name `yourusername`. Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username. For example, if your GitHub username is `Abhishek`, then the repository name will be `Abhishek`.
This repository will contain a README.md file that will be used to display your Hashnode blogs on your GitHub profile.

    height={320}
    width={920}
  />
</div>

### Add the pattern to README

Add the following pattern to the README.md file of the repository you created in the previous step.

```md
#### :books: Recent Blog Posts

<!-- BLOGPOSTS:START -->
<!-- BLOGPOSTS:END -->
```

That's how the GitHub Action would recognizes where it has to put the list of latest blogs.

### Create GitHub Action

Navigate to github.com/`<your-username>/<your-username>` and open up the "Actions" tab. Click "setup a workflow yourself" to create a new blank workflow.

<div align="center">

  />
</div>

### Add the workflow

Paste the exact same workflow configuration you see down here. (It syncs every 6 hours of the day. You can change its schedule by changing the cron value)

```yml
name: Hashnode Blog Posts
on:
  schedule:
    # Runs every 6 hours of the day
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-readme-with-blog:
    name: Update this repo's README with the latest blog posts
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow@master
        with:
          comment_tag_name: 'BLOGPOSTS'
          feed_list: '<link-to-your-rss>'
          template: '$newline - $randomEmoji(ðŸ’¯,ðŸ”¥,ðŸ’«,ðŸš€,ðŸŒ®) [$title]($url)'
          commit_message: 'recent posts section updated'
          gh_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Replace the feed_list value with `<your-domain>/rss.xml`. In my case, It's like this:

```yml
feed_list: 'https://abbhishek.hashnode.dev/rss.xml'
```

<div align="center">
  <Image
    src="/blogs/Hashnode Blogs on GitHub Profile/workflow.png"
    height={420}
    width={840}
  />
</div>

### We're Almost Done!

To test the result, open up the "Actions" tab and run the workflow manually only this time. To do that, select the action we just created from the left-hand side and click the "Run workflow" drop-down. Finally, press the "Run workflow" green button.

<div align="center">
  <Image
    src="/blogs/Hashnode Blogs on GitHub Profile/run-workflow.png"
    height={420}
    width={840}
  />
</div>

Wait a few seconds to get your workflow done. Once it's run successfully, head back to your GitHub profile and enjoy the result.
