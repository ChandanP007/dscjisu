                        On behalf of team CodeFest, we would like to publicly thank the generous sponsors without whom this event could not be held so smoothly. Our sponsors are an extension of our event, we make their presence obvious by integrating them in natural ways which promote their vision and brand. Till date our sponsors are very happy and eager to keep in business with us by supporting our vision with whole heart.
